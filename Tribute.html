  <h3> Keanu Reeves has had an extensive career spanning over 34 years</h3>
  
 <p> Keanu was best known for his roles in The Matrix Trilogy but there are many more films he has been cast in. One film in particular that I loved growing up was Point Break. In this film he played a federal agent who was infiltrating a group of bank robbers lead by a surfer named Bodhi. Bodhi was played by another well known actor, the late Patrick Swayze.</p>
